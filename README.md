This small POC application is a Text-to-SQL agent that allows you to query a sample SQLite database using natural language. It leverages the power of the LLM models to translate your questions into SQL queries, execute them, and provide you with the results and a human-readable explanation.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Natural Language to SQL:** Ask questions about your data in plain English.
- **Google Gemini Integration:** Utilizes the Gemini language model for intelligent SQL query generation and result explanation.
- **SQLite Database:** Includes an in-memory SQLite database with sample `client` and `orders` tables.
- **Database Schema Exploration:** Easily view the schema of the tables in the sidebar.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Adjust the Gemini model's temperature and the system prompt directly from the sidebar.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- pip (Python package installer)
- A Google Cloud project with the Gemini API enabled and an API key.

### Installation

1.  **Install the required Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env` file** in the same directory as your `app.py` and add your Google Gemini API key:

    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
    ```

    **Replace `"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"` with your actual API key.**

### Running the Application

1.  **Ensure you are in the project directory in your terminal.**
2.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3.  **The application will open in your web browser.** You can now start asking questions about the sample data in the input field.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The sidebar provides the following configuration options:

- **LLM Temperature:** Controls the randomness of the Gemini model's output. Lower values (e.g., 0.2) make the output more deterministic, while higher values (e.g., 0.9) make it more creative.
- **System prompt:** Defines the instructions given to the Gemini model, influencing how it generates SQL queries. You can modify this to adjust the agent's behavior.
- **Database schemas:** An expandable section that displays the schema (table names and column definitions) of the `client` and `orders` tables.

## üí° How to Use

1.  **Explore the database schema** in the sidebar to understand the available tables and columns.
2.  **Enter your natural language question** in the "Ask a question about the data..." input field at the bottom of the application.
3.  **The agent will:**
    - Display the generated SQL query.
    - Execute the query against the sample database.
    - Show the results in a table.
    - Provide a human-readable explanation of the results.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): For creating the interactive web application.
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): For handling and displaying tabular data.
- [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html): For the in-memory SQLite database.
- [google-generativeai](https://ai.google.dev/docs/reference/rest): The official Python library for the Google Gemini API.
- [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/): For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
